## Project Details
Sunbird ED is a platform that can be used to deploy scale-ready solutions in the area of learning, capacity building, and professional development. The platform provides capabilities for managing a variety of content in various languages.

This is to provide capability of translation of content from one English or an Indian language to other Indian languages using AI. This will greatly help content creators to utilize existing content and repurpose it in their one language.
